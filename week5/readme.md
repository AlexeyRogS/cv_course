# Week 5 (Image generation. GAN, VAE and DM)

This week is dedicated to image generation task. In particular we will be looking into how to build and train models to generate images. You will learn
the main approaches to this task by studying generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders and diffusion models.

* [Lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gfTDAW0teXF6iTW-Tlr_N_tHmc1IHJgyYlrn7d9Abic/edit?usp=sharing)
* Seminar on DCGAN (DCGAN.ipynb) where we build a famous model (DCGAN) using pytorch and train in to generate
images of celebrities faces using Celeb-A Faces dataset.
* gan_hw.ipynb is your template for the homework. In this homework you should implement wgan loss and check out how it works.
