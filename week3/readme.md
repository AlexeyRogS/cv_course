# Week 3 (Deep learning in CV introduction)

This week is dedicated mostly to image classification and CNN architectures.
You will learn how modern neural networks are built and why they work the
way they do. We will also get acquainted with pytorch - the most popular
neural network framework.

* Lecture [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PbdBzJU7ZtVS7HIvHXkm3Ydzi_iIaW7nDZG4x_MhYHw/edit?usp=sharing) where we talk about the history of CNN architectures.
* Practice with pytorch (torch_intro.ipynb)
