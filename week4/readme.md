# Week 4

This week is dedicated to object recognition tasks (in particular we will be looking 
into object detection task as the most interesting in practice). You will learn
how object detection models work and how to use them. That is how to train and
inference object detection models.

* A followup seminar on image classification. We review how optimization works and
how to use torch optimizers and build our first CNN for cifar classification (optim_cifar.ipynb)
* Lecture slides (coming soon...)
* Seminar on object detection models (coming soon...)
