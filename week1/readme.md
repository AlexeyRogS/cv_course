# Week 1

This week is dedicated to basic operations with images.
* During the first lesson, we will discuss what an image is,
and what we can do with it. You will learn how to read and alter
and write images using opencv in python. (opencv_basics.ipynb)
* During the second lesson, we will look into more operations
